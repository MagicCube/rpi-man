# rpi-web-man
A web-based management tool for Raspberry PI / Raspbian.

YES, indeed it is powered by `Node.js v6` on `Raspberry PI 3`.

>  This project is inspired by [vaslabs's](https://github.com/vaslabs) [pi-web-agent](https://github.com/vaslabs/pi-web-agent/wiki/A-web-application-agent-for-the-Raspberry-Pi) which is unfortunately not working for my Raspberry PI (I still don't know why...)



## 1. Features
